-  Sep. 2017~Jun. 2020 Ph.D. in Bioinformatics, HUST, Wuhan, China
   
-  Sept. 2015~Jun. 2017 M.S. in Bioinformatics, HUST, Wuhan, China
   
 - Sept. 2011~Jun. 2015 B.S. in Bioinformatics, HUST, Wuhan, China

## Skills

 - Familiar with **R/Bioconductor, Perl, Linux**  &  **Shell**  programming and **web server platform** development
 - Experienced with NGS data (e.g. RNA-Seq, miRNA-Seq, ChIP-seq) analysis and  **big data mining**
- Deep knowledge in search and application of biology databases (NCBI, UCSC, Ensembl, ENCODE, GO, KEGG etc.) and bioinformatics software (BWA, Bowtie, Cufflinks, ALLPATHS, MACS, samtools, Cytoscape etc.)
- Basic knowledge in machine learning and statistical analysis with R.

## Research experience
- developed GSCALite [1] (a web server for gene set cancer analysis [http://bioinfo.life.hust.edu.cn/web/GSCALite/](http://bioinfo.life.hust.edu.cn/web/GSCALite/)), a user friendly platform for scientists to validate their candidates in large-scale public data, including mRNA expression, miRNA regulation, genomics changes, drug association et al.
- Find the genomic landscape and mutational impacts of recurrently mutated genes in cancers [2].
- Demonstrated key regulators promote lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) development [4].
- Identified STAB1 as a prognostic factor for cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia and its drug indication [3].
- Got the immune landscape and power on predicting ICB response of immune regulators in pan-cancers [5].
- Obtained the landscape of cancer diagnostic biomarkers from specifically expressed genes [6].
